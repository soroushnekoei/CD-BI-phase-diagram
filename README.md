# project is based on the experimental data derived from "thermodynamic of materials"book written by David.R.Gakell as a reference.
# in this project we used gibbs free energy,entropy&enthalpy formulas which have been derived from the book refered above so by solving mathematic problems for deriving temperatures and alloy composition allows us to simulate CD-BI phase diagram by matlab
one of the features could be pointed out is predicting phase status corresponding to the composition given by examiner.
